# Pymaceuticals-Module-5-

In this assignment, 
I prepared the data by running package dependencies and merging Mouse Data and Study Results into one DataFrame.
I generated summary statistics that showed mean, variance, standard deviation, among other summarizing data into a readable chart.
After creating the summary statistics, I created bar charts and pie charts using both the DataFrame.plot() method and the pyplot method.
Additionally, I used quartiles, outliers, and boxplots to show final tumor volume of each mouse across all 4 treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. 
I used scatter plots and line plots to show specific data for 1 Capomulin mouse. The correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen was created using the .corr and the linregress after I imported scipy.stats.
After gathering and displaying my data, I wrote a brief and direct analysis that gives the reader a clear key point about the data given.
